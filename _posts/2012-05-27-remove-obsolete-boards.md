Sometimes it is annoying to see all old sketchboards on switch list. E.g. some drafts that you have abandoned and you wouldn’t like to see those on your list any longer. Therefore a board can be now removed from the switch list.

Open switch list and navigate to the board that you don’t want to see any longer. Board is removed only from the list, it is not removed from the database. Of course if it is a free board, it will be removed after 30 days.

Just in case if you did this by accident you can always open the removed url and board will be associated to you again. Hopefully you have the url somewhere :) That’s why board removal asks you to confirm the removal.
