Thanks for the feedback! 

One of the recently requested usability improvements is Drag & Drop Menu Scrollbars. Earlierly Drag & Drop menu has been using background dragging to reveal more items that are not visible. Functionality was the same as getting more space on the actual drawing area. However it has turned out to be not intuitive for the Drag & Drop menu, users have not found the feature. Therefore Sketchboard.Me Drag & Drop menu has been changed to support scrollbars to make it intuitive, how to reveal more items. It also makes usage more rapid, you can quickly scroll and reveal a needed item.

Scrollbars have been styled for webkit based browsers, e.g. Google Chrome and Safari. Non webkit based browsers have traditional looking scroll bars.
