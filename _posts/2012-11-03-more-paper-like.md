Sketchboard.Me got a new background and lighter drawing style. In this way board is more paper like and the old grey style is gone. Background tries to represent a white paper. By default the background of an item is transparent and border is black, which looks more like pen drawing on a paper. This doesn't prevent using colors!


**Example**. Paper like background and background color changed. Border has a little bit darker color compared to the item backround.

Color menu has now possibility to change the background and the border separately. When changing the background it is still automatically changing the border color as well.
