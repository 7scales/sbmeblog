Reuse diagrams by copying the current board as a new board. Select “Copy Board” and new board is created for you. This gives you a possibility to create alternative designs. Continue only with one that is better and ditch the other one. You can even create your own diagram template library.

Copy board button location depends whether you are logged in or not. When you are logged in you can copy the board from the switch board list.

When you are not logged in, copy button is directly available from the toolbar. Reasons for different location is that there has started to be quite many buttons in the toolbar. Also new users can quickly get started by copying from a read only example board. One reason is that logically user is switching a board, to sum these up, decision was to have two different locations.
