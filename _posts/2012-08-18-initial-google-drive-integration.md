Now Sketchboard.Me has an initial support for Google Drive. You can use Google Drive features with your sketchboards, share with your existing contacts, search sketchboards by a shortcut name and see who has last modified the board. 

Currently supported:
* Adding shortcuts from Google Drive Menu or from Sketchboard.Me itself
* Shortcut gets board name only once when created from Sketchboard.Me 
* **NOTE:** Shared files on Google Drive. Currently everyone can edit the board even though they have only viewer or commenter rights on Google Drive

* You need PRO account to use Google Drive integration (everyone will be pro during the alpha stage! :))
