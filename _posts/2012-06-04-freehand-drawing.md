One small step closer to what Sketchboard.Me tries to achieve, drawing a sketch using a pen and providing the same kind of support for thinking as paper and pen or a whiteboard sketching with others. Easily clarify the idea to yourself or others, but digitally and it doesnâ€™t matter where you or collaborators are.

Freehand drawing can be <strong>enabled</strong> from two different places, from a toolbar or from a quick drawing menu. The quick drawing menu can be opened by double clicking the board.

Once freehand drawing has been enabled, you will see a highlighted freehand drawing mode on top of the board. Draw to the board by using your mouse, left button down and move your mouse.

By clicking the top button, the freehand button on the quick drawing menu or on the toolbar you can disable the freehand mode.

Freehand drawing is not sampling all the points to minimize the data amount. It tries to keep the original shape, but drawing is little bit smoothened. You can also <strong>color fill</strong> the freehand drawing, but by default the fill is transparent. Select a color and you will get a background color for you drawing. To draw just the line, select transparent.

Note that you can also <strong>connect freehand</strong> items by using the connection helpers.
