One good practice to start a day is to make draft plan what should be done today.
It doesn't necessarily mean that you should accomplish everything, but at least
you will put your thoughts to a "paper" and you can concentrate on details.

- Use like 5 - 10 minutes when you come to the office and draft items that is 
most burning on your mind


- then start to focus on details so you don't constantly think about the things
you should be doing and you can focus!

Mark item as done ones you have completed it. In the end of the day
you can see what you have accomblished, since sometimes it feels
that you haven't accomblished anything even though in reality you have done quit a lot. You
just don't remember those at that moment. With this you have some structure
in your day and you can also visually see what has been done and go home with pride.

- in case you want to make sure you achieve something, reserve a time for it and mark it 
to a calendar. In case you want to have not so hard dead lines, add items to Sketchboard.Me
and plan your day in there.


- With a draft plan you also feel that you have accomblished something.
